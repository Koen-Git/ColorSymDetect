FILE:
main.m - code for computer symmetry on an image and display the candidates' info (axes, voting representation)
symBilOurCentLogGaborHSV.m - code for main function to compute symmetry on an image

OUTPUT FORMAT:
SymOcLgHSV :	(Cx6 Matrix) Information of symmetry candidates (sorted decendly)
				C --> Number of symmetry candidates
				Columns: x1,y1,x2,y2,score,normalized_score
				x1,y1,x2,y2 --> 2D coordinates of line endpoints representing a symmetry axis candidate
				score --> symmetry measure of a symmetry axis candidate
				normalized_score --> symmetry measure mormalized by maximum score				
voteMap	:		(MxN Matrix) Probability estimation of symmetry voting space (polar coordinate system)
				M --> number of bins for angular component
				N --> number of bins for displacement component
